Sampson. Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
Gregory. No, for then we should be colliers.
Sampson. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
Gregory. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
Sampson. I strike quickly, being moved.
Gregory. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
Sampson. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
Gregory. To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
Sampson. A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
Gregory. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.
Sampson. True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.
Gregory. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
Sampson. 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when 
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.
Gregory. The heads of the maids?
